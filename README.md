# PrimeGen

## About
This project was created just for fun to try out some maths theory about
primality checks (Miller-Rabin) and the RSA algorithm.

## Disclaimer
Do not use this project for any critical RSA encryptions. This is just a 
straight-forward approach not dealing with common security risks, etc.

## Licence
This software is available under the terms of the MIT licence.
